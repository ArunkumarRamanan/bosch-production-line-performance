# Bosch Production Line Performance
[Kaggle - Reduce manufacturing failures] (https://www.kaggle.com/c/bosch-production-line-performance)

## Introduction
The goal of this competition was to predict internal failures using thousands of measurements and tests made for each component along the assembly line, using one of the largest datasets hosted on Kaggle to date. <br>
Each part was labelled as either passing quality control (Response == 0) or failing quality control (Response == 1) and model predictions were evaluated using [Matthew's Correlation Coefficient] (https://www.kaggle.com/c/bosch-production-line-performance/details/evaluation).
