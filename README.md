# Bosch Production Line Performance
[Kaggle - Reduce manufacturing failures] (https://www.kaggle.com/c/bosch-production-line-performance)

## Introduction
The goal of this competition was to predict internal failures based on thousands of measurements and tests made for each component along the assembly line, using one of the largest datasets hosted on Kaggle to date. <br>
Each part was labelled as either passing quality control (Response = 0) or failing quality control (Response = 1) and model predictions were evaluated using [Matthew's Correlation Coefficient] (https://www.kaggle.com/c/bosch-production-line-performance/details/evaluation).

## Team Meambers
The team, Arrested Development, consisted of Tyrone Cragg and [Liam Culligan] (https://github.com/liamculligan).

## Performance
The solution obtained a rank of [39th out of 1391 teams] (https://www.kaggle.com/c/bosch-production-line-performance/leaderboard/private). with a private leaderboard score of 0.48726. <br> The 5-fold cross validation Matthew's Correlation Coefficient was 0.477665.
